I sent something to a buddy of mine who is a web designer/programmer who went to school for design. I thought his comments were worth posting with this. =P

> i heard something in a Lexus commercial (i think it was) to the effect of design is superior to art because with art you're creating something beautiful that anyone can interpret anyway they'd like to whereas with design you're creating something beautiful that everyone should interpret the same way. like marissa mayer says, and i agree, creativity loves constraint. combining the two ideas, design is more creative than fine art.
