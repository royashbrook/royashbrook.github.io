title: SimpleSniffer Updated to 1.0.0.2 (stable)
---

So I updated [SimpleSniffer](http://simplesniffer.codeplex.com/) with what I learned from all of my playing about lately. It seems quite fast to me. I have updated the latest release as ‘stable’ on CodePlex.

12 whole downloads so far, so maybe it helped someone else =P
