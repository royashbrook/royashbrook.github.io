title: Fit Window for All Pages Visio macro (FWAP!)
---

I have been editing a *lot* of Visio diagrams recently. One of the issues I have with a lengthy session of Visio editing is the documents all get kind of wonky sometime because I have zoomed a ton or something. This isn’t a big deal but if I want to screen share and blow through the slides really quick to review it’s a pain. Here’s a macro to fit each visio window to page. I call it FWAP (Fit Window for All Pages) =).

{% gist d99da13b9c2abc3a054584265772aa14 %}

So far my only sadness is that Visio 2010 doesn’t appear to have an option to just add the macro to the quick bar. Ah well, hotkeys to the rescue I suppose.
